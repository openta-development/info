Introduction
============

Content in OpenTA consists of exercises with one or many questions. An exercise and its questions are created using a custom `XML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_ format. For example,

`example.xml: <example.xml>`_

.. literalinclude:: example.xml
  :language: xml

.. raw:: html
  :file: example1.html

In this example the question type :ref:`compareNumeric` is used which compares the student answer with the correct answer by random sampling.

Mathematics typesetting
========================

OpenTA supports typesetting mathematical expressions in text through `KaTeX <https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/>`_. This means that whenever you want to show some mathematics, for example :math:`\frac{1+x^2}{\sqrt{1-x}}`, you write the corresponding `LaTeX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX>`_ syntax within dollar signs: :code:`$\frac{1+x^2}{\sqrt{1-x}}$`.

See `the LaTeX wiki <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics>`_ for a syntax reference.

For some more hands-on examples see `this stackexchange collection <https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference>`_ (this is aimed at MathJax which also uses the same syntax).
