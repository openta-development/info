File structure
==============

Exercises are stored on the server's file system. An exercise consists
of a directory containing a definition file ``exercise.xml`` together
with a file ``exercisekey`` and possibly additional assets such as
``figures/pdf``. This directory must be located somewhere under the root
``exercises/`` directory to be recognized by the system.

`exercise.xml`
--------------
An XML file containing all information about the exercise, see below for the XML format.

`exercisekey`
-------------

A text file containing a unique key (up to 255 bytes of UTF8 encoded ASCII) that identifies the exercise to the database. A key file can be added and assigned manually, but is automatically generated as a `uuid4 <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/uuid.html>`_ identifier if not present.

This first part describes the XML tags that are common to all exercises.
