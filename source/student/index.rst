Problems with LTI access:
-------------------------
* Multiple OpenTA identities or a hash as username ?
		-  This has happened for GU students taking Chalmers courses.
		- Make sure you are logged in only through the Chalmers Canvas.
* Access denied  : `Please enable cookies (and third-party cookies) to access OpenTA`
		- Canvas sets third party cookies to open an app in a frame.
		- Enable third party cookies in your browser
		- If you don't want to allow all third party cookies, allow those from ``[*.]instructure.com``
* Update your browswer; OpenTA enforces security settings that are violated in earlier browswers.
* If you still get problems with LTI access write an email

Several methods; the examiner has chosen one and it should be obvious from the OpenTA page.  All methods require
a valid email from which you will need to retrive an email from `opentaproject@gmail.com`
