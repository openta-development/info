OpenTA
######

OpenTA is primarily designed to allow teachers to present assignments
and exercises to questions where answers are are given using
mathematical formulas. It provides the opportunity for a student to
supplement these answers with by uploading handwritten material which
the teacher can then review to provide additional feedback and grade
if assigning a grade is a goal.

OpenTA allows teachers to monitor student progress by seeing what
tasks the students are actively working on and how well they have
resolved outstanding tasks. The teacher can monitor both individual
responses and overall statistics. They can also see recent response
attempts, both correct and incorrect for a given question. It is
possible for the teacher look in detail at a given student and see how
they are faring in the course.
